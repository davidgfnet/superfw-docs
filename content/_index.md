## Compatibility

SuperFW is compatible with the regular Supercard SD/MiniSD/MicroSD variant as
well as the smaller _Lite_ version. The Compact Flash variant and the _Rumble_
variants are *not* compatible. SuperFW is the main firmware for newer carts
such as the _SuperChis_.

SuperFW works well with most commercial GBA games as well as most homebrew. It
can support some ROM hacks and similar derived games using its powerful
patching tool.

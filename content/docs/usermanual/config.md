Additional configuration knobs to make SuperFW's usage more enjoyable.

There are certain configuration knobs that can help to get the most out of
your Supercard. Some of these knobs are experimental and can crash your
console. Tread with care!

### Fast ROM loading

SuperFW attempts to maximize the performance of the Supercard. This can however
be incompatible with some consoles, carts or SD cards. If you experience issues
while loading your ROMs (ie. ROM loading errors, or crashes/glitches) you can
try disabling the faster ROM loading. This should come at a performance cost
but might make your device and cart work well.

### EWRAM overclock

Since Supercard is slower than regular carts, you can compensate some of this
slowdown by overclocking the EWRAM memory. It works on GBA devices (original
and SP) except the GBA Micro. NDS devices do not support this overclocking either.
However there are reports of some GBA devices not working well with overclocking
(probably less than 1%), so it might depend on your device.
